** Synopsis
The goal for this project is a way of looking up, storing, and retrieving
information for one's books. Using the [[https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books][Open Library]] and [[https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started][Google Books]] APIs, the
user can look up a book by ISBN, and instantly get information such as the
book's author(s), publication date, and subject keywords. The user can then
augment this info with their own notes, such as where the book is kept or a
photo. All of this is saved in a database, and the list of entries can be easily
filtered and searched within the native application.

The purpose of this application is to make it easy for people with vast book
collections to be able to find any book they need, and also manage their
inventory efficiently.

With the use of a barcode scanner, inputting in each book becomes significantly
faster.

** Tech
Backend is written in OCaml, GUI is written in Racket.
